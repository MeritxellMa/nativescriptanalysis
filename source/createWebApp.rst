Is it possible to use same code to create a WebApp?
===================================================

If you use NativeScript+Angular you can reuse a lot of your mobile code in order to build the web.

In `this link <http://shripalsoni.com/blog/create-native-mobile-and-web-app-with-single-codebase-using-angular2-and-nativescript/>`_ you can find some information like:

* What files/folders you can reuse 
* The directory structure you have to use to share the data
* How to create and use shared code

If you have more time (20 minutes) you also can watch `this presentation <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3nyG2xtzeQ>`_ at ng-conf about sharing code.
