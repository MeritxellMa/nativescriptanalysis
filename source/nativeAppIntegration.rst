Is it possible to use Native Android App in NativeScript?
=========================================================

Still not sure.

In one hand we have `this tutorial <https://www.nativescript.org/blog/plugins-and-jars>`_ about using java classes through a plugin of Android app.

In the other hand we can extend our Android project with NatvieScript as it says`this link <https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/integration-with-existing-ios-and-android-apps/extend-existing-android-app.html>`_ 

Also there's the possibility to use our Android project as a third-party library `like this <https://developer.telerik.com/featured/using-native-libraries-in-nativescript/>`_

Although I still didn't test this options and didn't find a good exemple how can I share data between my NativeScript project and my Android code yet.
